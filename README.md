## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the core functions for loading and preprocessing data, building the cosine similarity matrix, and generating movie recommendations.
- `GUI.py`: Provides a Tkinter-based GUI for the movie recommendation system.
- `credits.csv`, `keywords.csv`, `movies_metadata.csv`: The datasets used for building the recommendation system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
